# Search and Rescue Drone System

## Abstract
Hiking is an enjoyable and health-enhancing activity, but it can also be perilous. When hikers go missing, search and rescue (S&R) missions become essential. This project introduces a model-based system that utilizes autonomous drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras, regular cameras, and GPS to optimize the search for lost individuals in remote areas. Simulation trials indicate that this system can locate missing persons more efficiently and cost-effectively than traditional S&R methods.
